#### Getting your agents started
When introducing your agents to Agent Assist, you can control rollout and set up training groups by enabling recommendations for particular skills.

##### Leveraging skills with Agent Assist
Think about the knowledge and bots you want to expose through each skill serviced by human agents.  Optimize recommendation results by only connecting relevant sets of knowledge and bots to particular skills.  For example, an agent servicing billing questions should receive billing-related recommendations.

#### Focused bots
Build task-focused bots. Then let your agents disambiguate the consumer request and deploy the right bot for the task to the conversation. 

#### Use your existing content
Intentfully leverage your existing content using LivePersonâ€™s CMS connector and prebuilt intent domains.
