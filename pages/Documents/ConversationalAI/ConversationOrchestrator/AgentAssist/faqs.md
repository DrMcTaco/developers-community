#### I created a few knowledge bases, but I don’t see them within Agent Assist. Why is this?

This happens if any of the following conditions are true:

* The knowledge base is empty, i.e., it doesn’t have any articles yet. In this case, add some articles.
* The knowledge base has articles, but none of the articles are enabled yet. In this case, enable some articles.
* The knowledge base is a legacy knowledge base, so it isn't supported within Agent Assist. In other words, it uses Knowledge Base intents and the LivePerson (Legacy) NLU engine behind the scenes. In this case, download the knowledge base and import the export file into a new knowledge base. All new knowledge bases use the LivePerson NLU engine by default.
